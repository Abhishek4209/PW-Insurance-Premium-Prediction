  <h1>Welcome to Insurance Premium Prediction</h1>

  <p> Most people do not buy Health insurance thinking that it will cost higher money for premium but, the insurance premium price depends on various factors. In this project we have build a ML model
      that can predict medical expenses based on several features of an individual such as age,gender,body mass index (BMI),region and No. of Children so that, a Person can choose health insurance plan
      accordingly by keeping the projected cost from our study in mind. Also it will help medical insurance companies to make decision on charging the premium for particular customer.
